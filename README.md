# Street Parking Management

A Microsoft Future Ready Talent Project with the title of Street Parking Management in the catogory of Earth.

This is a web application for managing street parking spots in a city. The application allows users to view available parking spots on a map, reserve a parking spot, and pay for parking using a credit card. The application is hosted on an Azure Static Web Page and integrated with an Azure Chatbot for user service.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can visit the Azure Static Web Page URL to access the application.

https://brave-water-065e9b810.3.azurestaticapps.net


## Usage

- Once you have the application open in your web browser, you can view available parking spots on the map by clicking the "Show Map" button. The map will be displayed in an iframe below the button.

- To access the login page, click on the menu button in the top left corner of the screen. This will open a side panel with options for logging in or signing up. once you logged in you can check your username on the sidepanel.

- You can then reserve a parking spot by clicking on the map and selecting a spot. A popup will appear asking you to confirm your reservation and enter your credit card information to pay for the parking spot.

- If you need to cancel your reservation, you can click on the "Cancel" button in the popup. If you need to change your credit card information, you can click on the "Change" button in the popup.

- Once you have paid for your parking spot, you will receive a confirmation message and the map will update to show that the spot is no longer available. You can then park in the reserved spot for the duration of your reservation.

- If you need any assistance while using the application, you can interact with the Azure Chatbot integrated with the application. The chatbot will provide you with user service and help you with any issues you may face while using the application.

## Advantages

Using this application can help reduce pollution by reducing traffic congestion. By providing users with a way to reserve parking spots in advance, the application can help reduce the number of cars circling around looking for parking spots, which can lead to reduced traffic congestion and lower emissions.

## Future Implementations

Here are some potential future implementations for this project:

1. Adding a search feature for users to search for parking spots by location.
2. Implementing a waitlist for users to join when all parking spots are reserved.
3. Adding a timer for reservations to ensure that users do not exceed their allotted time.
4. Improving the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
5. Adding a feedback system for users to provide feedback on their experience using the application.
6. Adding IoT services for better service, such as using sensors to monitor parking spot availability and occupancy.
7. Adding security services for monitoring parked cars and using sensor cameras to measure the status of the parking spots.

We welcome contributions from the community to help implement these features and improve the application. If you would like to contribute, please follow the guidelines outlined in the "Contributing" section of this README file.
